North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the Americas. This viewpoint was common in the United

If continents are defined strictly as discrete 
[model] -> landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro-Eurasia. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.

The six-continent combined-Eurasia model is mostly used in

The six-continent combined-America model is often used in Spain, Latin America,[25] Greece,[15] Portugal, France and its former possessions, Italy, and Romania.

Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia.[66] In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.
